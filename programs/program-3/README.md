# Wizard Shooty Game (By Carter Landry)
## Description:
This is a game that contains a Wizard, Spells, and a Spider. If the Spider hits the right side of the screen, the Wizard loses a life. However, if the Wizard hits the Spider with a Spell by pressing "Space", the Spider will die and the Wizard will gain a point. If all lives are lost, the game will restart.

## Improvements:
1. Made the Spider move at random speeds when it respawns.
2. Made the Spider appear at a "random" time after hitting the right side of the screen or being hit with a Spell   
`(The Spider teleports past the left border of the screen 100-400 pixels away, making it seem like a new Spider, but in reality, is just the same Spider teleported).`
3. Added a start menu.
4. Added a death menu that appears when all lives are lost, aswell as restarts the game when you "press any key to restart".
5. Added sound effects for firing Spells, hitting the Spider with a Spell, and losing a life.

## Running the Game:
run the main.py file in the src folder.
